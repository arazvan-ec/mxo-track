# Multi-Agent Workflow: Compound

Capture insights from completed features to make future development easier.

## Philosophy

> "Each unit of engineering work should make subsequent units easier—not harder"
> — Compound Engineering Principle

The `/workflows:compound` command is the key differentiator of compound engineering.
Without it, you're just doing work. With it, work builds on work.

## The 70% Problem Awareness

> "AI helps you reach 70% quickly, but the remaining 30% is where real complexity lives."
> — Addy Osmani, Beyond Vibe Coding

When capturing learnings, pay special attention to **where the 70% ended and the 30% began**:

```
Feature Timeline:
├── 0-70%: Fast progress (AI excels)
│   └── Scaffolding, CRUD, happy paths
│
└── 70-100%: Slow progress (Human expertise needed)
    ├── Edge cases
    ├── Error handling
    ├── Security hardening
    └── Integration issues
```

**Questions to answer in compound capture:**
- Where did progress slow down? (The 70% boundary)
- What caused the "two-step-back" pattern? (Fixes introducing bugs)
- What would have prevented the slowdown if known earlier?
- What should future specs include to avoid this?

This awareness helps future planning account for the **real complexity**, not just the easy 70%.

## Flow Guard (prerequisite check)

Before executing, verify the flow has been followed:

```
PREREQUISITE CHECK:
  1. Does tasks.md exist for this feature?
     - NO: STOP. This feature has not been through the workflow.

  2. Is QA status = APPROVED in tasks.md?
     - NO (REJECTED): STOP. Review was rejected. Fix issues and re-review first.
     - NO (other): STOP. Review has not been completed. Run /workflows:review first.
     - YES: Proceed with compound capture.

  If either check fails, do NOT proceed.
```

## Usage

```bash
# After QA approval (includes automatic spec updates)
/workflows:compound user-authentication

# Disable automatic spec updates
/workflows:compound user-authentication --update-specs=false

# Only update specs (skip other compound steps)
/workflows:compound user-authentication --specs-only
```

## Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--update-specs` | `true` | Automatically update project specs after feature completion |
| `--specs-only` | `false` | Only perform spec updates, skip pattern capture and other compound steps |

## When to Run

Run after:
- ✅ Feature is APPROVED by QA
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Ready to merge

## What This Command Does

### Execution Strategy: Parallel Subagents

This command can launch multiple specialized subagents IN PARALLEL to maximize efficiency:

**Parallel Subagents (Optional - for thorough documentation):**

| Subagent | Task | Returns |
|----------|------|---------|
| **Context Analyzer** | Extract feature context, problem type, components | YAML frontmatter skeleton |
| **Solution Extractor** | Analyze investigation steps, find root cause | Solution content block |
| **Related Docs Finder** | Search docs/solutions/ for related documentation | Links and relationships |
| **Prevention Strategist** | Develop prevention strategies, test cases | Prevention/testing content |
| **Pattern Recognizer** | Identify reusable patterns and anti-patterns | Pattern documentation |

**Launch with:**
```
Task general-purpose: "Analyze the conversation history for this feature.
Extract: problem type, component affected, symptoms, and root cause.
Return YAML frontmatter for docs/solutions/"

Task general-purpose: "Search docs/solutions/ for related documentation.
Find: cross-references, similar issues, related patterns.
Return: list of related files and suggested links"
```

**Sequential Steps (Main Flow):**

### Step 1: Analyze Feature History

```bash
# Get all commits for the feature
git log --oneline feature/${FEATURE_ID}

# Get diff from base branch
git diff main...feature/${FEATURE_ID}

# Analyze files changed
git diff --stat main...feature/${FEATURE_ID}
```

### Step 2: Extract Patterns

Identify what went well:

```markdown
## Patterns Identified

### Pattern 1: Email Validation Value Object
**Where**: src/Domain/ValueObject/Email.php
**Why it worked**: Encapsulates validation, immutable, reusable
**Recommendation**: Use for all email fields in future entities

### Pattern 2: TDD for Use Cases
**Where**: tests/Application/CreateUserUseCaseTest.php
**Why it worked**: Found 3 bugs during Red phase before implementation
**Recommendation**: Always write use case tests first
```

### Step 3: Identify Anti-Patterns & The 70% Boundary

Document what should be avoided AND where progress slowed:

```markdown
## Anti-Patterns Found

### Anti-Pattern 1: Skipping Integration Tests
**Where**: Initial implementation had no API tests
**What happened**: 500 error found only during QA
**Cost**: 2 extra iterations to fix
**Rule**: Always write integration tests for new endpoints

### Anti-Pattern 2: Incomplete API Contract
**Where**: proposal.md missing error response formats
**What happened**: Frontend had to guess error handling
**Cost**: 3 back-and-forth messages to clarify
**Rule**: Always specify all error responses in contracts

## The 70% Boundary Analysis

### Where did the 70% end?
**Milestone**: Basic CRUD working, happy path tests passing
**Time spent**: 2 hours (40% of total)

### What made the 30% hard?
1. **Edge case**: Email already exists scenario
   - Not in original spec
   - Required new validation logic
   - Added 1 hour

2. **Security**: Password hashing integration
   - bcrypt config not documented
   - Trial and error with rounds
   - Added 45 minutes

3. **Integration**: Frontend form validation mismatch
   - Backend and frontend had different rules
   - Required sync meeting
   - Added 30 minutes

### What would have helped?
- [ ] Spec should include ALL error scenarios upfront
- [ ] Security requirements should reference existing patterns
- [ ] Validation rules should be in shared contract

### Prevention for future features
- Add "Error Scenarios" section to spec template
- Create validation rules library (shared between BE/FE)
- Document security patterns in project_specific.md

### Dimensional Learnings

After feature completion, capture dimensional insights:

1. **Dimensional accuracy**: Did the diagnostic (from `/workflows:discover`) correctly classify the project's dimensions for this feature?
   - If YES: Diagnostic is reliable for this dimension
   - If NO: Document what was wrong and why (e.g., "diagnostic said synchronous but feature required async")

2. **Dimensional drift**: Did this feature change any dimension?
   - New external API added? → `data_source_topology` may have changed
   - New consumer platform? → `consumer_diversity` may have changed
   - Async patterns introduced? → `concurrency_model` may have changed
   - If any dimension changed → recommend running `/workflows:discover --refresh` to update diagnostic

3. **Constraint effectiveness**: Were the dimensional constraints from design.md useful during implementation?
   - Which constraints prevented bugs or bad patterns?
   - Which constraints felt unnecessary or wrong?
   - Feed back to improve constraint rules in `core/templates/api-architecture-diagnostic.yaml`
```

### Step 3b: Update Agent Compound Memory

After documenting anti-patterns and the 70% boundary, update `.ai/project/compound-memory.md`:

```markdown
# Update compound-memory.md with this feature's data

## For each anti-pattern/pain point found in Step 3:

1. Check if pain point already exists in compound-memory.md:
   - EXISTS: Increment frequency (e.g., "2/5 features" → "3/6 features"), update severity if worse
   - NEW: Add new entry under "Known Pain Points"

2. For each successful pattern found in Step 2:
   - EXISTS: Increment reliability counter
   - NEW: Add new entry under "Historical Patterns"

3. Recalculate Agent Calibration table:
   - ≥2 related pain points for an agent → intensity = HIGH
   - 1 related pain point → intensity = default + warning flag
   - 0 related pain points → intensity = default
   - ≥3 reliable good patterns → may LOWER intensity (team is consistent)

4. If a pain point or pattern has been present for ≥5 features:
   - PROMOTE to project rules (global_rules.md)
   - Mark in memory: "[PROMOTED to global_rules.md on ${DATE}]"
```

The Agent Compound Memory specification is documented in Step 3b above.

### Step 3c: Enrich Architecture Profile

After documenting patterns and anti-patterns, update the project's architecture profile:

1. **Read** `openspec/specs/architecture-profile.yaml`
   - If file does not exist → skip this step with note: "No architecture profile found. Run /workflows:discover --setup to generate one."

2. **Update learned_patterns**: For each successful pattern identified in Step 2:
   - If pattern not in `learned_patterns` → add with `confidence: low` and `source_features: [{current_feature}]`
   - If pattern already exists → increment confidence (`low` → `medium` → `high`) and append current feature to `source_features`

3. **Update learned_antipatterns**: For each anti-pattern discovered in Step 3:
   - If anti-pattern not in `learned_antipatterns` → add with `frequency: 1` and `prevention` note
   - If anti-pattern already exists → increment `frequency`

4. **Update reference_files** (if applicable):
   - If a new file exemplifies a principle better than the current reference → update `solid_relevance.{principle}.reference_good`
   - If new reference files emerged for archetypes → update `conventions.reference_files`

5. **Adjust quality_thresholds** (if applicable):
   - If actual project data shows thresholds are wrong (e.g., average class LOC significantly different) → adjust accordingly

6. **Write** updated `openspec/specs/architecture-profile.yaml`

### Step 4: Update Project Rules

If patterns are generalizable, update rules:

```markdown
# Additions to global_rules.md

## Email Validation (Added from user-authentication feature)
All email fields must use the Email value object pattern:
- Create src/Domain/ValueObject/Email.php
- Validation in constructor
- Immutable (no setters)
- Reference: src/Domain/ValueObject/Email.php from user-auth feature
```

### Step 5: Create Compound Log Entry

Append to `.ai/project/compound_log.md`:

```markdown
# Compound Log

## 2026-01-16: user-authentication

### Summary
Implemented user registration with email/password authentication.
3 iterations to complete Domain layer, 2 for Application layer.

### Time Investment
- Planning: 2 hours (40%)
- Implementation: 2 hours (40%)
- Review: 30 minutes (10%)
- Compound: 30 minutes (10%)
- **Total**: 5 hours

### Learnings Captured

#### Patterns to Reuse
1. **Email Value Object** - Use for all email validation
   - File: src/Domain/ValueObject/Email.php
   - Tests: tests/Unit/Domain/ValueObject/EmailTest.php

2. **Registration Form Pattern** - Use for all auth forms
   - File: src/components/RegistrationForm.tsx
   - Tests: src/__tests__/RegistrationForm.test.tsx

#### Rules Updated
- global_rules.md: Added Email VO requirement
- framework_rules.md: Added Value Object immutability check

#### Anti-Patterns Documented
1. Skipping integration tests → Added to QA checklist
2. Incomplete API contracts → Added template requirement

### Specs Updated
Records what project specifications were created or modified by this feature.

#### Entities
| Entity | Action | File |
|--------|--------|------|
| User | CREATED | openspec/specs/entities/user.md |
| EmailVO | CREATED | openspec/specs/entities/email-vo.md |

#### API Contracts
| Endpoint | Action | File |
|----------|--------|------|
| POST /api/users | CREATED | openspec/specs/api-contracts/users.md |
| GET /api/users/{id} | CREATED | openspec/specs/api-contracts/users.md |

#### Business Rules
| Rule ID | Action | File |
|---------|--------|------|
| BR-AUTH-001 | CREATED | openspec/specs/business-rules/authentication.md |
| BR-AUTH-002 | CREATED | openspec/specs/business-rules/authentication.md |
| BR-AUTH-003 | CREATED | openspec/specs/business-rules/authentication.md |

#### Spec Manifest Update
- Timestamp: 2026-01-16T14:30:00Z
- History entry added: Yes
- Files affected: 5

### Impact on Future Work
- Next auth feature (password reset) can reuse:
  - Email VO ✓
  - Form pattern ✓
  - Test structure ✓
- **Project specs now reflect**: User entity, users API, auth rules
- Estimated time savings: 30-40%

### Questions for Future
- Should we create a shared auth package?
- Is JWT refresh token pattern documented?
```

### Step 6: Update Feature Templates

If new templates discovered:

```bash
# Save successful patterns as templates
cp openspec/changes/user-auth/proposal.md \
   .ai/workflow/templates/proposal_auth_template.md
```

### Spec Flow Pipeline

The spec flow ensures feature-level specs merge into the project baseline:

```
/workflows:plan → openspec/changes/{slug}/specs.md (feature specs)
                                    ↓
/workflows:compound → Step 7: Diff Analysis (compare feature vs baseline)
                                    ↓
                    → Step 8: Merge to openspec/specs/ (project baseline)
```

Plan Phase 2 reads `openspec/specs/` as baseline context before generating feature specs. Compound closes the loop by merging feature changes back into the baseline.

### Step 7: Spec Diff Analysis

Compare feature specifications with existing project specs to identify changes:

```bash
# Feature spec files to analyze
FEATURE_SPECS="openspec/changes/${FEATURE_ID}/specs.md"
FEATURE_SOLUTIONS="openspec/changes/${FEATURE_ID}/design.md"

# Project spec directories
PROJECT_ENTITIES="openspec/specs/entities/"
PROJECT_API="openspec/specs/api-contracts/"
PROJECT_RULES="openspec/specs/business-rules/"
```

#### Spec Diff Report Generation

```markdown
## Spec Diff Report: ${FEATURE_NAME}

### New Entities Detected
| Entity | Source File | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| User | specs.md:45 | NEW |
| EmailVO | design.md:23 | NEW |

### Modified Entities
| Entity | Changes | Source |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Account | +passwordHash field | specs.md:67 |

### New API Endpoints
| Endpoint | Method | Source |
|----------|--------|--------|
| /api/users | POST | design.md:89 |
| /api/users/{id} | GET | design.md:95 |

### New Business Rules
| Rule ID | Description | Source |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| BR-AUTH-001 | Email must be unique | specs.md:120 |
| BR-AUTH-002 | Password min 8 chars | specs.md:125 |

### New Patterns Identified
| Pattern | Location | Reusability |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| Email Value Object | Domain/ValueObject | High |
| JWT Token Strategy | Infrastructure/Auth | Medium |
```

#### Diff Analysis Process

1. **Parse feature specs** (specs.md):
   - Extract entity definitions
   - Extract acceptance criteria
   - Extract business rules

2. **Parse feature solutions** (design.md):
   - Extract implementation patterns
   - Extract API contracts
   - Extract architectural decisions

3. **Compare with existing project specs**:
   - Check `openspec/specs/entities/` for existing entities
   - Check `openspec/specs/api-contracts/` for existing endpoints
   - Check `openspec/specs/business-rules/` for existing rules

4. **Generate diff report**:
   - NEW: Entity/endpoint/rule not in project specs
   - MODIFIED: Entity/endpoint/rule exists but changed
   - UNCHANGED: Already in project specs

### Step 8: Update Project Specs (NEW)

Automatically update project specifications to reflect the new feature state:

```bash
# Skip if --update-specs=false
if [[ "${UPDATE_SPECS}" == "false" ]]; then
    echo "Skipping spec updates (--update-specs=false)"
    exit 0
fi
```

```

#### Using the Spec-Merger Skill

```bash
# Invoke spec-merger skill for intelligent merging
/workflow-skill:spec-merger \
  --feature="${FEATURE_ID}" \
  --source="openspec/changes/${FEATURE_ID}/" \
  --target="openspec/specs/" \
  --mode=merge  # merge | overwrite | dry-run
```

The spec-merger skill:
1. Parses feature specs and solutions
2. Identifies new/modified specs
3. Merges changes preserving existing content
4. Updates manifest with timestamps
5. Creates backup before modifications

## Compound Metrics

Track compounding effect over time:

```markdown
## Compound Metrics

| Feature | Planning | Implementation | Review | Compound | Total | Patterns |
|---------|----------|----------------|--------|----------|-------|----------|
| user-auth | 2h | 2h | 0.5h | 0.5h | 5h | 3 new |
| password-reset | 1h | 1h | 0.5h | 0.5h | 3h | 2 reused |
| profile-edit | 0.5h | 1h | 0.5h | 0.5h | 2.5h | 3 reused |

**Trend**: Each feature takes less time as patterns compound.
```

## The Compound Effect

```
Feature 1: 5 hours + 3 patterns captured
Feature 2: 3 hours (reused 2 patterns) + 2 new patterns
Feature 3: 2.5 hours (reused 4 patterns) + 1 new pattern
Feature 4: 2 hours (reused 5 patterns)

Total: 12.5 hours for 4 features
Without compounding: ~20 hours (5h each)
Time saved: 37.5%
```

## State Update

After compound capture:

```markdown
## Feature: user-authentication
**Status**: COMPLETED + COMPOUNDED
**Compound Date**: 2026-01-16
**Patterns Captured**: 3
**Rules Updated**: 2

### Compound Summary
- Email VO pattern documented
- RegistrationForm pattern documented
- Integration test requirement added to rules
- Estimated 30-40% time savings on similar features
```

## Best Practices

1. **Run immediately after QA approval** - Context is fresh
2. **Be specific about patterns** - Include file paths
3. **Quantify impact** - "Saved 2 iterations" not "was helpful"
4. **Update rules** - Make patterns enforceable
5. **Reference future work** - Connect to next features

## Compound Effect Over Time

```
Month 1: Establishing patterns (slower)
Month 2: Reusing patterns (faster)
Month 3: Pattern library mature (much faster)
Month 6: New features feel like "already done"
```

The compound effect is why planning matters: good planning creates good patterns, good patterns accelerate future work.

## Structured Documentation (docs/solutions/)

For permanent institutional knowledge, create files in `docs/solutions/` with YAML frontmatter:

### Directory Structure
```
docs/solutions/
├── performance-issues/
├── database-issues/
├── runtime-errors/
├── security-issues/
├── integration-issues/
├── ui-bugs/
├── logic-errors/
├── test-failures/
├── build-errors/
├── best-practices/
└── patterns/
    └── critical-patterns.md   # Must-know patterns for all work
```

### Frontmatter Schema
```yaml
---
title: "N+1 Query Fix for User Dashboard"
category: performance-issues
tags: [orm, n-plus-one, eager-loading, database]
module: UserDashboard

---
```

### When to Create docs/solutions/ Entry

Create a structured solution document when:
- Problem took >30 minutes to diagnose
- Root cause was non-obvious
- Pattern applies to multiple modules
- Security or data integrity issue
- Performance degradation >50%

### Auto-Invoke Triggers

<auto_invoke>
<trigger_phrases>
- "that worked"
- "it's fixed"
- "working now"
- "problem solved"
- "tests passing"
- "QA approved"
</trigger_phrases>

<manual_override>
Use `/workflows:compound [feature]` to document immediately.
</manual_override>
</auto_invoke>

### Project Specs Directory Structure

After compound with spec updates:

```
openspec/
├── config.yaml                  # Rules from feedback loop (70% boundary)
├── specs/                       # BASELINE — updated only by compound
│   ├── spec-manifest.yaml       # Central registry with history
│   ├── entities/
│   │   ├── user.md              # User entity spec
│   │   ├── email-vo.md          # Email value object spec
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── api-contracts/
│   │   ├── users.md             # Users API endpoints
│   │   ├── auth.md              # Auth API endpoints
│   │   └── ...
│   └── business-rules/
│       ├── authentication.md    # Auth domain rules
│       ├── user-management.md   # User domain rules

    └── ${FEATURE_ID}/
        ├── proposal.md

## Retrospective

After compound capture is complete, generate a brief retrospective:

```markdown
# Retrospective: ${FEATURE_ID}

## What went well
- [1-3 bullet points]

## What could improve
- [1-3 bullet points]

## Surprises / Lessons
- [Unexpected findings during implementation or review]

## Metrics
- Planning phases: [N]
- Implementation tasks: [N] completed, [N] blocked
- Review cycles: [N] (rejections before approval)
- BCP activations: [N] (by deviation type)
```

Write this to `openspec/changes/${FEATURE_ID}/99_retrospective.md`. This file is optional but recommended for features with `planning_depth=full` or features that required multiple review cycles.

## Error Recovery

- **QA status not APPROVED**: Compound requires QA APPROVED status. If status is REJECTED, do not proceed — fixes must be implemented and re-reviewed first.
- **Spec-merger conflicts with baseline**: If merging feature specs into `openspec/specs/` produces conflicts, present both versions to the user. User decides which version becomes the new baseline.
- **Missing compound_log.md**: Create it fresh. The log is append-only — a missing file means this is the first compound capture for the project.
- **Feature artifacts incomplete**: If proposal.md, specs.md, design.md, or tasks.md are missing from `openspec/changes/${FEATURE_ID}/`, log a warning and capture what's available. Do not block compound on missing optional artifacts.
